# Diet Optimization Model

## Introduction

The diet optimization problem aims to find the most cost-effective combination of foods that meets a set of nutritional requirements. This is a classic example of a linear programming problem where the objective is to minimize the cost of the diet while satisfying nutritional constraints.

## Problem Formulation

### Objective

Minimize the total cost of the selected foods.

### Variables

- \( x_i \): The quantity of food item \( i \) to be included in the diet.

### Parameters

- \( c_i \): The cost per unit of food item \( i \).
- \( a_{ij} \): The amount of nutrient \( j \) provided by one unit of food item \( i \).
- \( b_j \): The minimum required amount of nutrient \( j \).

### Nutrients and Foods

Consider a diet problem with the following components:

#### Foods
- \( n \) different types of food items (indexed by \( i \)).
  
#### Nutrients
- \( m \) different types of nutrients (indexed by \( j \)).

### Constraints

1. **Nutritional Requirements**: The total amount of each nutrient \( j \) provided by the selected foods must be at least \( b_j \).
   
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{ij} x_i \geq b_j \quad \text{for all } j = 1, \ldots, m
   \]

2. **Non-Negativity**: The quantity of each food item must be non-negative.
   
   \[
   x_i \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } i = 1, \ldots, n
   \]

### Mathematical Model

Putting it all together, the diet optimization model can be formulated as:

#### Objective Function

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i x_i
\]

#### Subject to:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{ij} x_i \geq b_j \quad \text{for all } j = 1, \ldots, m
\]

\[
x_i \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } i = 1, \ldots, n
\]

## Example

### Foods and Costs

| Food Item | Cost per Unit (\$) |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Food 1    | 0.5                |
| Food 2    | 0.8                |
| Food 3    | 0.3                |

### Nutrients and Requirements

| Nutrient   | Minimum Requirement |
|------------|---------------------|
| Nutrient A | 50                  |
| Nutrient B | 30                  |
| Nutrient C | 40                  |

### Nutrient Content per Unit of Food

| Food Item | Nutrient A | Nutrient B | Nutrient C |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| Food 1    | 10         | 20         | 10         |
| Food 2    | 20         | 5          | 20         |
| Food 3    | 15         | 10         | 15         |

### Model

Given the above data, the model can be formulated as:

#### Objective Function

\[
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = 0.5x_1 + 0.8x_2 + 0.3x_3
\]

#### Subject to:

\[
10x_1 + 20x_2 + 15x_3 \geq 50 \quad \text{(Nutrient A)}
\]

\[
20x_1 + 5x_2 + 10x_3 \geq 30 \quad \text{(Nutrient B)}
\]

\[
10x_1 + 20x_2 + 15x_3 \geq 40 \quad \text{(Nutrient C)}
\]

\[
x_1, x_2, x_3 \geq 0
\]

## Solution

To solve the diet optimization problem, we can use linear programming techniques or software tools such as MATLAB, Python with SciPy, or optimization libraries like Gurobi or CPLEX.

By solving the above model, we can determine the optimal quantities of each food item that minimize the cost while meeting the nutritional requirements.

## Conclusion

The diet optimization model is a practical application of linear programming that helps in determining the most cost-effective way to meet dietary requirements. By defining the objective function, variables, constraints, and parameters clearly, we can use mathematical optimization techniques to find an optimal solution.
